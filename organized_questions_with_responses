The Obama campaign put data science on the map, but it hasn't gotten down to the state level yet in most places. Perhaps you could do a summer white paper project for the party of your choice.\n\nI'm in the same situation you are.

It's basic python stuff that a basic search on the error you got (*local variable referenced before assignment*) would turn up. You need to declare a variable before you use it.

            "SAS will be a good item on your resume. I'd say it's probably more \"employable\" than R. That said, I like R a lot more and believe you can do more with R. For instance, R has a lot more cutting-edge algorithms (if that's what you need) because developers will often release a library when they publish their paper describing a new algorithm.\n\nAll that said, I'd also recommend picking up python. It's a great general use langauge, and it has a pretty powerful (and growing) data science toolkit. People used to complain that it was slow, but this isn't really a problem anymore with the advent of certain libraries (numpy, numba, scipy, statsmodels) for accomplishing fast linear algebra.",
            "Depends where you want to work. \n\nMost start-ups deal almost primarily with R. \nMore established companies deal mostly with SAS. \n\nObviously there are exceptions to this, but that's the gist of it. ",
            "If the company you are working for is paying for SAS then you'll use SAS. If not, then you'll use R. \n\nThe languages are nothing alike and both have terrible syntax. That being said, I use R at my current job and I do sometimes miss the canned reporting and visuals in SAS. \n\nIf you're company is shelling out the big bucks then SAS EM is pretty fucking amazing. ",
            "SAS is useful in that it will almost certainly force you to learn SQL too (for use within SAS). But in terms of job prospects, most tech companies go for R (though as /u/AwesomeRecruiter said, banks and other established places will use SAS).",
            "Perhaps other people's experience differs, but I mostly see SAS being used for more pure statistics jobs. While R is also used in many of those sorts of jobs, I personally have never seen what I'd call a Data Science job that requires SAS. This is probably more a cultural distinction than anything else. \n\nAs an aside, I'd always suggest learning a free tool with a strong community around it over a proprietary alternative unless you have a very specific reason to use the proprietary tool.  ",

            "Most importantly: if you are paying for the learning yourself you will probably have no choice but R. If your company is paying then maybe they will opt to let you learn SAS. SAS classes are EXPENSIVE (frequently over 1000 USD per class). SAS licenses (to practice on) are even more expensive. R is free and there are a TON of free resources for learning R on the web. This is also why most universities teach R instead of SAS. \n\nIn my opinion R is better anyway because of the breadth of packages. But cost is certainly a very big driver.",

In general SAS still has the lead is massive data-sets but this is rapidly changing - but it has the advantage of already being the incumbent. The great thing about R is that it is Open Source (so you can use it at home), has excellent packages and evolves at a faster pace. On Kaggle R is the most popular language by some distance. I do agree that overall SAS is right now the marginally better then R for getting a high paying job - but over time I believe R will catch up and overtake. Python is growing very quickly and is much nicer to write straight forward programs (for instance web scraping etc), has a growing sci-kit learn package, and makes it relatively easy to do things like Deep Learning through Theano (that is making use of the GPU to compute Neural Net). In short start with R as its free and has the biggest range of packages or Python if you prefer a full programming language that will not take too long to learn.

        "mistral_response": "While model accuracy is an essential metric in machine learning, it's crucial to remember that achieving the highest possible accuracy isn't always the most important goal. Overfitting, underfitting, or even having a model that is \"too accurate\" can lead to issues when applying the model to new data.\n\nInstead, focus on other factors such as interpretability, generalizability, and efficiency. A model that is easy to understand and explain to stakeholders can be more valuable than one with slightly higher accuracy but complex internal workings. Additionally, a model that can effectively handle new, unseen data will prove more beneficial in the long run than one that performs well only on training data.\n\nMoreover, consider the computational resources required to train and deploy your machine learning models. A less accurate yet efficient model may be the better choice if your resources are limited or if you need to process large volumes of data quickly.\n\nSo while accuracy matters, remember to keep it in perspective and prioritize other factors that contribute to a successful machine learning project.",
        "faclon_response": "I'm responding to this post to make the point that model accuracy isn't the only thing to consider when choosing between different machine learning algorithms. Sure, it's important to get the most accurate results possible, but there are other factors to consider as well. \n\nFirst of all, it's important to understand that machine learning algorithms don't simply take a set of inputs and return a prediction. They take into account the complexity of the data they're processing, the size of the dataset, the type of data being used, and many other variables. Therefore, when comparing different algorithms, it's not just a matter of accuracy but also of efficiency and effectiveness in handling the data.\n\nThat being said, if you want to be sure that your algorithm is producing the most accurate results possible, it's important to test your code on a variety of datasets to ensure that the results are consistent. Additionally, you can use different validation techniques to check the accuracy of your algorithm, such as cross-validation and random sampling.\n\nIn conclusion, while accuracy is important, it's not the only factor to consider when selecting a machine learning algorithm. There are other factors to take into account, such as efficiency and effectiveness in handling the data, and these should be considered alongside accuracy.<|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "I disagree with the notion that model accuracy is less important than you think. Accurate machine learning models are crucial for making informed decisions and achieving business goals. While it's true that there are limitations to the precision of any model, ignoring the importance of accuracy can lead to suboptimal decision-making and potential repercussions on your bottom line.\n\nIn today's data-driven world, machine learning models are used to inform critical business decisions such as product development, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. Inaccurate models can result in wasted resources, lost opportunities, and a decline in customer satisfaction. Therefore, it's essential to prioritize model accuracy when developing and deploying machine learning models.\n\nWhile it's true that there are instances where a highly accurate model may not be the best choice (e.g., in situations where the cost of false negatives outweighs the cost of false positives), it's important to prioritize accuracy whenever possible. By investing in accurate machine learning models, you can make more informed decisions and achieve better business outcomes."

        "responses": [
            "I'm very much a data science newbie.  But here's my attempt to answer your question.\n\nExcel is both very powerful and very limited in data analysis.\n\nPros: a lot of quick and dirty analysis can be done using Excel.  Data manipulation is easy and fast.  Particularly with Excel 2013, it's very easy to mash data together from different data sources.  PowerPivot is a nice way to \"import\" data from SQL sources.  Popular data mining addin = XLMiner.\n\nCons: Limited in size of data sets, and it can get extremely slow and unstable with large amounts of data.  Analysis is very biased towards financial applications.  Programming is Excel is very clunky (I'd rather let python do the heavy lifting if necessary).\n\nExcel really needs a database engine and/or business intelligence backend to perform a lot of the heavy analytics.  Nevertheless, it's a good tool.\n\nFor resources, I was recently introduced to this book, and it seems promising:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Using-SQL-Excel/dp/0470099518\n",
            "Spreadsheets are great for limited data sets. That said, most graphic representations are accomplished in other programs such as [Origin](http://www.originlab.com/). I don't think that I have ever seen a graph on an academic paper that came from a spreadsheet file. It is fine for classwork, but not for published work.\n\nExcel is the Microsoft version of a spreadsheet. Since we live in the new millennium, I would recommend using a more portable format, such as [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/). Not because it has more features, but because it doesn't require a paid license, so you can share the document with anybody without fear that they can't open it. They can simply download OpenOffice for free. \n\nThe other, and possibly best, option is Google Drive. It requires no local storage, and its graphing capabilities are always improving. You can share with as many people as you would like, or even make it public to the world. If you have partners on the project, you can even collaboratively edit in real time. \n\nOf course, if your data set is very large, you should look towards a database of some kind. I have been moving towards PHP and MySQL for some time. With this option, you can build a simple form, available over the internet, in which collaborators can add data to your set. The world revolves around the internet today. Make it easy to access your data by using the cloud. \n\nIf there are proprietary issues, you can build a simple verification system. There are plenty of tutorials on how to do so. \n\nThe problem with using large data sets with Excel is that everything is diplayed. That means that if you have many thousands of data points, they all must pass through the GPU before you can manipulate them. If your data set is on the order of Gigabytes, then forget about it. Your computer will throw a fit. That said, I have manipulated data with hundreds of thousand of data points with Excel, with only a minor lag inconvenience. \n\nIf you want to learn more about spreadsheets and how to use them, I would recommend simply jumping in to a project and using Google to aid you in your endeavors. Pick a program (Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Drive) and start making what you want. When you encounter a problem, search for an answer on Google and you will find what you need within the first few results. As your needs grow more complex, you may need to search harder, but the answer is there if you ask the right question. \n\nThis is the state of modern computer science. ",

It hasn't let me down except for some export to Excel stuff but you really shouldn't be doing reporting with an ETL tool anyway. There is of course performance tradeoffs between using any ETL tool and straight SQL/scripting but the amount of time you save and being able to reproduce with a tool like Pentaho make it worth it.\n\nIf you are serious about it I would suggest  [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Pentaho-Kettle-Solutions-Building-Integration/dp/0470635177).

It's not as nice as other visualization suites though.\n\nWhile I'm impressed with Excel alternatives, Excel has become the de facto standard for spreadsheets (at least in the business world).  OpenOffice/LibreOffice doesn't come close to the analytical capabilities of Excel.  While I adore FOSS, Excel is pretty much peerless when it comes to providing analytics from a spreadsheet program.\n\nOh and Google Drive is terrible for data analysis.

There are various tricks to get it to perform faster (namely, delaying formula updates and working with values only).\n\nAnd while I agree with the Pentaho suggestion, it's really overkill for JUST data cleansing a SINGLE large file.  Bash tools + [scripting language of choice] seems like a better way to handle this.  Kettle (or other ETL tools) are great if you need to integrate data from multiple sources (e.g. integrate data together from various CSV and XML files, an API, and a database).",
            "My biggest problem with Excel is that when most people use it, they don't leave behind code to describe what they have done.

And programming in VBA will cause you to develop poor programming habits.  Also, VBA programming is a ghetto.  You may be able to find work in a particular job with it, but nobody will respect your contributions and none of your learning in VBA will be respected by potential employers.\n\nThat said, there are some small tools in Excel that can be helpful.  It's easy to do ad hoc data cleaning with Excel.  It's easy to do pivot tables &amp; charts with Excel.  There's some OK statistical and financial functions in Excel.  And if you're interested in linear programming, there's the Solver function in Excel which is fairly easy to use.\n\nI think your best strategy for using Excel would be for ad hoc, manual processes that you can do one-off functionality.  The danger and temptation is that your one-off procedure will become super-popular and you'll be tempted to write a VBA macro (should be avoided) or even worse, VBA forms (just don't) in order to make a little application.\n\nVBA is like toxic waste - don't get any on you.  Don't rely so heavily on Excel that it prevents you from learning a real programming language.  Don't learn Excel in depth.  Just enough to get a job done and then ignore.

        "mistral_response": "Unix and its various flavors like Linux are popular operating systems for data scientists due to their robustness and versatility. Here are some essential Unix commands for data science tasks:\n\n1. `cd`: Change directory, navigate through your file system efficiently.\n2. `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.\n3. `pwd`: Print working directory, know where you currently are.\n4. `cp`: Copy files or directories, make duplicates of data or projects.\n5. `mv`: Move or rename files and directories, reorganize your data.\n6. `rm`: Remove files or directories, delete unwanted data.\n7. `grep`: Global regular expression print, search for specific text in files.\n8. `awk`: A powerful text-processing language for data manipulation and analysis.\n9. `sed`: Stream Editor, transform text through scripts, a good alternative to Awk.\n10. `ssh`: Secure Shell, connect remotely to other systems for collaborating or accessing large datasets.\n\nThese Unix commands cover common data science tasks such as file management, searching, and data manipulation. Mastering them will greatly enhance your productivity.",
        "faclon_response": "A great question for data scientists! Here are some useful Unix commands to help you get started. \n\nFirst, let's start with the basics. The command line interface can be a bit daunting at first, but it's an essential skill for data scientists. To navigate and edit files, type \"cd\" followed by the directory path of your files. For example, if your files are located in your home directory, you would type \"cd ~\" to get there quickly. \n\nNext, let's talk about file manipulation. If you want to copy a file, the \"cp\" command is easy to use. For example, if you want to copy a file named \"data.csv\" from your Downloads folder to a directory called \"data\", type \"cp data.csv data\" to complete the task. \n\nAnother useful command is \"mv\". This command will move files from one directory to another. For instance, if you want to move \"data.csv\" from Downloads to \"data\" directory, type \"mv data.csv ~/data\". \n\nThe \"find\" command is useful for locating files and folders. You can use it to find files based on their name or type. For instance, if you want to find all files in your Downloads folder with the extension \".csv\", type \"find ~/Downloads -name '*.csv'\". \n\nFinally, we can talk about data cleaning. The \"tr\" command is useful for trimming white space from the beginning and end of a line. For example, if you have a file called \"data.txt\" that contains a lot of extra spaces, you can clean it up using the \"tr\" command. Simply type \"tr -d '\\0'\" to delete all whitespace characters. \n\nI hope these commands help you get started in your data science journey!",
        "llama2_response": "As a data scientist, there are several Unix commands that you may find particularly useful in your work. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:\n\n1. `ls`: This command allows you to list the files and directories in your current directory. You can also use it to navigate through your file system by typing `ls <directory>` or `ls -l` for a detailed list.\n2. `grep`: This command allows you to search for specific patterns in one or more files. Use it like this: `grep <pattern> <file(s)>` or `grep -r <pattern> *` to search all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.\n3. `awk`: This command allows you to perform text manipulation and filtering tasks. Use it like this: `awk 'BEGIN {print \"Hello, world!\"}' file.txt` to create a new file with the contents of the specified file.\n4. `sed`: Similar to `awk`, `sed` is used for text manipulation and filtering tasks. Use it like this: `sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt` to replace all occurrences of \"old\" with \"new\" in a file.\n5. `sort`: This command allows you to sort the contents of a file or multiple files. Use it like this: `sort -n file.txt` to sort the contents of a file numerically.\n6. `uniq`: This command lists only the unique lines in a file or multiple files. Use it like this: `uniq file1.txt file2.txt` to list the unique lines in both files.\n7. `pandas`: If you're working with Python and data science, `pandas` is an essential tool for managing and analyzing data. It allows you to read and write data from CSV, Excel, and other formats. Use it like this: `import pandas as pd` and then perform operations on the data, such as `pd.read_csv(\"file.csv\")` or `pd.write_excel(\"file.xlsx\", data)`.\n\nThese are just a few examples of useful Unix commands for data science. Familiarize yourself with these commands to streamline your work and make it more efficient."

Also, you should be determining her staple ingredients relative to some kind of mean: it's not that meaningful to say she uses lots of sugar in her desserts: your task should be to show that she uses *more* sugar than we would expect in those desserts. Some approaches you could take:\n\n* For each PD recipe, scrape down 50-100 different versions of the same recipe, and determine how her ingredients differ from the \"mean\" recipe. maybe just compare the confidence interval for sugar against the amount she uses.\n\n* When given a recipe that includes pre-made products, attempt to decompose these products into their constituent ingredients. this is probably non-trivial going off just nutrition facts, but I suspect you can find a \"make you own XXX\" database of recipes you can query for this transformation.\n\n* Once you have your final analysis complete, you could try doing an association analysis to determine which ingredients frequently appear together. You could even feed groups of ingredients into a markov model of some kind to generate complete recipes (this is the most common technique used for generating random sentences from n-grams)",

This is a pretty big problem. Second, if this isn't what you are trying to do, you shouldn't make positive assertions like this one:\n\n&gt; Though Paula Deen’s name is very much aligned with the term “butter,” the chart clearly shows that she is a bigger fan of sugar.\n\nThe reason people make accusations that she uses lots of butter is because here recipes call for more butter *than other recipes of the same kind would*. If you're specifically investigating desserts (and the butter claim is absolutely not limited to desserts) than you should expect to see lots of sugar used regardless of whose recipe you are looking at. I wouldn't assert that paula is a \"bigger fan of sugar\" than she is of butter if you're only looking at her dessert recipes and haven't determined what a normal amount of sugar or butter is for those recipes. \n\nDesserts have lots of sugar in them. Your prior expectation should be that there will be lots of sugar. You shouldn't be rating her preference for an ingredient based on how much of it she tends to use: you should be measuring it using something like z-score or mahalanobis distance. Otherwise, I'd recommend you don't make those kinds of assertions at all.\n\n&gt; initial regression using pure data suggests that i add 15 grams of nutmeg per every gram of flour (the data set is sparse). using my subject knowledge in this area tells me that i must to bias the data to get an edible result.\n\nUsing a regression is a pretty naive method to come to the sort of product you're aiming for. It dismisses a lot of context. You might try grouping recipes together and do a hierarchical regression or something like that, but I would suggest that you should be aiming to get conditional probabilities, since certain ingredients simply will not go together, and other ingredients specifically complement each other. Hence my suggestion to use a markov chain.",

You can continue on the way you are, but I don't think it will be correct to say your developed recipe will really be representative of the universe of PD recipes, only a select subset.

        "faclon_response": "Machine learning is a powerful tool in the kitchen and can be used to create delicious dishes with just one ingredient! In the case of Paula Deen's desserts, machine learning can be used to improve the texture, taste, and presentation of the desserts. \n\nOne way to use machine learning in the kitchen is to analyze the texture of the batter and adjust the recipe accordingly. The batter should be thick enough to prevent any spreading and should hold its shape after baking. To achieve this, the recipe can be adjusted to include a stabilizer or cornstarch to help create a thicker texture. \n\nFor example, a recipe that calls for cream of tartar can be modified to add a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of white vinegar. This will help create a thicker batter and prevent spreading. \n\nIn terms of taste, machine learning can be used to analyze the flavor of the ingredients in a recipe. To do this, the recipe can be modified to include additional flavors, such as chocolate or fruit. The machine learning algorithm can then analyze the taste of these ingredients and adjust the recipe accordingly to improve the overall flavor. \n\nFinally, machine learning can be used to improve presentation. For example, the shape of a cake can be analyzed to determine the appropriate number of layers and batter to create the desired result. This can be used to ensure even baking and prevent over-mixing. \n\nOverall, machine learning can be a great tool to improve the texture, taste, and presentation of Paula Deen's desserts.

Weather data is easily obtainable, and often has major influence on sales.  That can help him determine staffing levels, or maybe decide to run a \"rainy day special\" to keep inventory from spoiling.\n\nGL.",
            "Thanks very much for your reply! I take it you have done this sort of data analysis for retail clients before. Is there any resources/papers/books you would recommend? Do you ever detrend sales data to isolate sales growth or determine how seasonally dependent sales are?"

            "You should pay a visit to your university's library, or at least Google:  \"your university's name\" \"data management plan\". You might be surprised with what you find.\n\nSpecifically, the National Science Foundation and most other Federal grant agencies have a requirement that researchers (to wit, grant seekers) have a two-page [Data Management Plan](http://www.nsf.gov/eng/general/dmp.jsp) that addresses how the researcher intends to store their data so that it can be shared and reused.\n\nThis task has fallen mainly on the libraries. I know this because I am doing a consulting project for a research university near me in which I am surveying top tier research universities across the U.S. and writing a report detailing best practices.\n\nAnyway, many university libraries have decent data services organizations that help grad students and professors in *exactly* the problem area you are concerned with: how to store research data. Some universities have their own repositories, but better still, many disciplines have their own national or regional repositories.\n\nAlso, developing metadata schemas and such is a core competency of librarians. So again, the library is the place to go for that.\n\n[Here's an example of Johns Hopkins and their approach.](http://dmp.data.jhu.edu/preserve-share-research-data/preserve-archive/)\n\nOn a related note, there is a move afoot in the library world to determine and meet the \"data information literacy\" needs of grad students and faculty. You might Google around a bit to to get a better sense of the sorts of skills and knowledge you can expect to need with respect to data management during your career. Again from Johns Hopkins, [here's a study that takes a look at that issue](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/portal_libraries_and_the_academy/v011/11.2.carlson.html).\n\nFinally, in view of the fact that data management at universities is by and large falling on librarians, you might want to x-post this to [/r/libraries](http://www.reddit.com/r/libraries).\n\nThis is actually a huge topic area, and I could write several pages, but I think you have enough to get you started.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n",

By understanding the terms of these agreements and negotiating them thoughtfully, employees can ensure that their rights are protected while also respecting the legitimate interests of their employers."

I know nothing of them except reading a few brief descriptions on the internet, but I **DO** know that they are a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nAn MS that would be worth your money and time would be a program in statistics with a heavy emphasis on computational machine learning.  If I were to go back to school for an MS, I would go that route.\n\nLearning business intelligence is very useful.  SSAS is also nice to have (MDX is a very useful language BTW, and very few people know it).  This experience is very valuable and I wouldn't be so quick to leave for school.  That being said, you'll need to do some studying on your own if you want to move away from the structured data that is BI and start doing more data science stuff.\n\nAt this point, I would look into data mining tools built into SQL Server and SSAS.  Try to engineer some models into your current environment.  Also, pick up a programming language.  Python and R are easier choices.  Java is also marketable but harder to learn.",
            "Based on my own experiences in school and the market:\n\nI can tell you that industry for whatever the hell reason thinks that experience &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education. This is of course going to vary by industry sector, but it appears to be true in general unless you're in an area where a Ph.D. is a necessity. \n\nYou're going to need SQL, Java/Python/Hadoop, and some stat go with it all, probably in that order. For a true Data Science position, they're more interested in the programming side than that hard core stat side. \n\nIf I were you, I'd make sure that I have the programming first and while working, see if you can expand your role a bit to where you're in a consultative role. \n\nThe education isn't valued as much as common sense would tell you. Maybe watch a few videos on Khan academy or something. Pick up a book on Regression, Data Mining, and basic statistics and you should probably be good there. \n\nAgain, this all depends on what sector you want to work in. ",
            "Are you referring to IT/Programming or Data Science.? Because my view of the industry is that in IT/Programming/Software Engineering/DBA etc. self taught, experience is what really matters. Data Science appears to be a different animal, most jobs I see want Masters/Ph.d level Statisticians. A person can just pick up a book and learn to program, but the same is not really true with Data Science, where there is broad usage of applied mathematics and statistics and, well, science. \n\nex: I was just at a Data Science/Analytics Conference and all speakers were Masters or Ph.D level. \n\nThat's just my 2c. \n\nEdit: of course Data Science is not a specific field and there are lot of related skills, setting up hadoop clusters, running jobs, cleaning data, queries, data modeling etc.. many of which programmers/dbas may already have.

Would grad school be a good way to sort of solidify my foundation, or still something that's fine to do on the job?\n\nAlso what do you think a \"true\" data scientist does on a daily basis?",
            "Grad school solidifying your foundation would depend entirely on what it is that you're doing. If you want to know more about stat, then absolutely, grad school would help. \n\nI would think that a data scientist spends the day programming to query data and create visual models to describe what's going on in the data. Basically SQL on steroids paired up with visual analytics. If the work were more heavy on the analysis and lighter on the programming, they'd probably be traditionally called some variant of a \"Statistician\". \n\n\"Data Science\" like \"Big Data\" seem to be bastardized terms nowadays. I don't have a clear picture myself of what each are because it depends on who you ask and what industry they're in. Everyone thinks they've got a mountain of data and to analyze it, they need a \"Data Scientist\". \n\nBased on what I've seen, yes, go for the grad degree if it won't interfere with your ability to keep a full time job. If it means having to quit, then I wouldn't. For some dumbass reason, people in general believe that experience beats education by a mile.

If there's a page of former students, that's great.  Otherwise, Google/LinkedIn is your friend here too.  See where they ended up.  Reach out to them and ask for their candid opinion of the school/program.\n\nAlso, take a gander at the computer science department as well.

            "Edit distance (levenshtein) is a good general purpose tool. Jaro-winkler is good for strings of moderate length (definitely not a whole document, but a sentence would be fine) but is definitely costly computationally. For really short strings soundex is pretty fast, but jaro-winkler is probably still better. stemming usually helps a lot, as does additional problem-specific pre-processing (i.e. normalization). Pretty basic stuff, I guess, but it gets the job done. Hell, you'd be surprised how far you can get just normalizing capitalizaiton.",
            "I've heard of the Levenshtein distance, but am not a big fan of it at all.  I've tried it with a couple of comparisons here at work, and \"general purpose\" is a pretty good description of it.  If two strings are not the same length it seems pretty useless to me for comparison.  I'll take a look at Jaro-Winkler ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) if anyone is interested).  At first glance it seems to be much better.",
            "keep in mind: because of the \"winkler\" correction, short strings whose first for letters match the target string can get unusually high scores using jaro-winkler. ",
            "Really depends on what your goals are for the comparison - I find the simplest thing I can that scales well and then adapt to oddities\\issues.  Review is critical.\r\rQuestions that have mattered:  How long are the strings?  Grouping so fewer comparisons are needed?  Finding likely mistakes and reasonable corrections?  Semantic distance?  Search ranking between query and a target?  Maximizing matching or differentiation?  Does it need to scale really well in targets and/or sources?  Are there specific semantics for the strings, or just generally?  User or machine generated?  Is it entity resolution?  Are linguistic normalizations important?  Are you comparing cross-language?  Cross dialect?  Levels of speech?  Are the strings from different time periods?  Is it pattern-based or literal-based?  Is data sparse?  Are they simple categorical values, or ordinal in a meaningful way?\r\rLots of what I've done is very simple (bag of words, or exact matching only) and had any complexity in weighting of differences and sources.  Often, I don't need perfection - just looking for prominent features and removing noise until something appears.  Occasionally, I have used translation models for a sort of semantic difference.  I intend to use search results returned as another more powerful semantic distance measure.  Rarely I'm modeling distance in terms of user actions rather than characters or tokens so UX understanding is important.\rWith enough data, fancy techniques (which often are a sort of dimensionality reduction) can be harmful.\r\rFWIW",

        "mistral_response": "Hello! In Python, comparing strings involves using the equal sign (==) or other comparison operators like less than (<), greater than (>), and so on. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n\n- Equal to (==): Compares two strings for exact equivalence in terms of their characters, order, and length. For example, `\"apple\" == \"apple\"` returns `True`.\n- Not equal to (!= or !=): Reverses the comparison made by the equal sign. For instance, `\"apple\" != \"banana\"` evaluates to `True`.\n- Less than (<): Determines if the first string comes before the second alphabetically. For example, `\"apple\" < \"banana\"` returns `True`.\n- Greater than (>): The opposite of less than; checks if the first string follows the second in the alphabetical order.\n- Less than or equal to (<=): Compares two strings and returns True if the first comes before the second, or if they are identical.\n- Greater than or equal to (>=): Reverses the comparison made by less than or equal to.\n\nRemember that Python is case-sensitive, so be sure to account for case when comparing strings. Also, consider using built-in functions like `str.lower()` and `str.isalnum()` for more complex string comparisons.",
        "faclon_response": "The following is a helpful response to the question posted on the forum:\n\nString comparison is a fundamental operation in programming, and understanding how to do it is important to ensure correct and efficient code. In this article, I will explain how to compare strings in C++.\n\nTo compare two strings in C++, you can use the 'strcmp' function. This function takes two strings as arguments and returns zero if they are equal, and a non-zero value if they are different. If you have a large number of strings to compare, using a loop to iterate over them is recommended. \n\nHere is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the 'strcmp' function:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    string s1 = \"Hello\";\n    string s2 = \"World\";\n    if (strcmp(s1.c_str(), s2.c_str()) == 0) {\n        cout << \"The strings are equal.\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"The strings are not equal.\" << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the 'strcmp' function is used to compare the strings s1 and s2. The function returns zero if the two strings are equal. If the strings are not equal, the program will print a message indicating the difference. \n\nWhen working with large numbers of strings, it is often better to use a loop to iterate over them. For example:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    string s1 = \"Hello\";\n    string s2 = \"World\";\n    int size1 = strlen(s1);\n    int size2 = strlen(s2);\n    for (int i = 0; i < size1 - 1; i++) {\n        if (strcmp(s1.c_str(), s2.c_str()) == 0) {\n            cout << \"The strings are equal.\" << endl;\n        } else {\n            cout << \"The strings are not equal.\" << endl;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the loop iterates over the strings s1 and s2, using the 'strcmp' function to check if they are equal. The loop continues until the function returns, indicating that the strings are not equal. \n\nOverall, string comparison is an important operation in programming, and understanding how to use the 'strcmp' function is essential for ensuring accurate code.<|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "Question: How do I compare strings in Python?\n\nResponse: In Python, you can compare strings using the `==` operator. For example, `“Hello” == “World\" will return `False`. You can also use the `not equal` operator (`!`) to check if two strings are not equal. Additionally, you can use the `in` operator to check if a string is present in another string. For example, `“apple” in “Apple computer\" will return `True`."

            "I've been a \"data scientist\" for a large financial corporation for a few years now. Obviously that's not what my role was called as the term had not been coined back then.\n\nMy role has evolved from building customised interactive insight tools all the way to data cleansing, shaping, modelling, and taking on numerous tasks that our IT support and COO division should have been doing for us. (e.g. Learning how to be a DBA, procuring our own data warehousing infrastructure, dealing all the wonderful politics that come with it, setting up data feeds from production systems, etc etc). Today we do some pretty crazy stuff using unconventional methods and having to play a lot of politics when it comes to acquiring data from other silo'd divisions who are often very protective of their little world. When we come across something interesting it nearly always feels like an \"of course, why didn't we try this before?\" type of revelation.\n\nAs both the company and our team evolved heavily, especially in the sense of changing the company's culture to be more receptive of modern information-based innovation, our team has become the centralised keystone that linked all the different divisions of the company together. Demand for our work has never been higher, and is ever-increasing at an alarming rate. There is never a spare moment and there is never enough time in the day to achieve the things we want to achieve.\n\nOur corporation has historically never been interested in data in the modern sense. Sure there have been hundreds of people producing reports, fiddling with Excel, and the ones who think they are smart have bought BI software and started messing with that to produce dashboards etc, but there hasn't been a lot of innovation until our department was formed. Anyone can create charts, dashboards, KPIs etc. But not many people have the creativity and lateral thinking to take it a step further, and then take one more step in feeding it all back into the system for everyone to see and benefit (almost like a supercharger for an engine).\n\nI'm sure there's a lot of debate around the semantics of \"data science\", but I think there are a huge number of aspects to it that not everyone understands (one day everyone will, the same way 15 years ago it was said: \"one day everyone will own a cell phone\").\n\nData can be used to find the answers to virtually any conceivable question, as it is omnipresent and links literally everything to everything else. Due to that very nature, the \"science\" aspect of it extends and interlinks with potentially everything it touches. Be it the ability to measure the performance of a business, modelling outcomes to validate predictions, be used simply as a conduit for changing the way a business is run, change the outcome of long term company strategies, assist in geo-political matters, predicting stocks / weather / etc, the list is endless.\n\nI feel very lucky to be placed in the position I am in today as a \"data scientist\". I have all the tools and a heavy amount of technical skills to hand, yet I'm heavily involved in the outcomes and innovative ideas and decisions that will impact this company in a huge way. We are in a golden age for \"data science\", the momentum of its recognition is beginning to pick up. And those of us who were here already have a great head start."

            "&gt; Is Gist some sort of github/blog hybrid?\n\nIt uses [GraphGist](http://gist.neo4j.org/), which is a simple platform provided by Neo4j for sharing snippets of code/queries etc. when working on, or demonstrating Neo4j. \n\nYou can post a marked-up snippet (including data, code, queries) on your Dropbox, or on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) (the paste-bin of Github), and pass the url to GraphGist, which returns a dynamically updated page with styling, evaluates the queries, provides a console, etc.\n\nFor instance, the source of the posted page is [this](https://gist.github.com/nmwhite0131/8173017) document. You can copy-paste or fork that, [modify it](https://gist.github.com/mhermans/8198456), and render a [changed version](http://gist.neo4j.org/?8198456) by just changing the url. \n\nGreat for learning/sharing/collaborating.\n\n(not the author btw)",
            "Very cool research.  I've never done Cosine Similarity before.  A .86 seems a little high for their similarities considering they differed so greatly for Forrest Gump and The Social Network.  Have you tried to scale your numbers before using the algorithm on it?  I wonder how it would change the numbers.\n\nHave you tried it with additional data points?  How long did this take to run, and is it feasible for very large data sets?\n\nIf you're interested, I actually just did some research from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes movie ratings that resulted in the following pictures. They both utilized Kernel PCA (Radial Basis kernel function) of 6,270 different movie ratings using 5 different types of ratings.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/lpWJikX.jpg) is a picture of the results in 2d form, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/85KUbPg.jpg) is in 3d form.  I found that green are the best movies, red are the \"okay\" movies, and black are the worst movies.  If you are interested in more, let me know.  \n\nAgain, cool presentation.  I liked the interactivity of it.  Well done!"

        "mistral_response": "To make movie recommendations using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Cosine Similarity in R and Neo4j, follow these steps:\n\n1. Import required packages: In R, install and load the `neo4jR`, `IRlearn`, and `dplyr` packages.\n\n2. Connect to Neo4j: Use `src_connect()` from `neo4jR` to establish a connection with your Neo4j database.\n\n3. Query data: Execute a Cypher query to fetch movie ratings, genres, and user preferences from the graph database. Store the results in R as a data frame using the `data_frame()` function.\n\n4. Preprocess data: Use functions like `tfidf()` from `IRlearn` to convert text data into numerical vectors (like movie genres). This will help calculate cosine similarity between movies.\n\n5. Cosine Similarity: Compute the pairwise cosine similarities between all movies using the `cosine_sim()` function.\n\n6. k-NN algorithm: Use `knn()` from `IRlearn` to find the k-nearest neighbors based on the cosine similarity matrix and user preferences.\n\n7. Generate recommendations: Based on the k-nearest neighbors, generate movie recommendations for a given user by fetching their titles, genres or other relevant features from the Neo4j database.\n\n8. Close connection: Don't forget to close the connection with Neo4j using `src_disconnect()`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a movie recommendation system that takes advantage of both graph databases (Neo4j) and similarity measures (k-NN & Cosine Similarity).",
        "faclon_response": "I'm an AI language model and I can provide some movie recommendations based on a K-NN algorithm using R and Neo4j. \n\nK-NN is a machine learning algorithm that uses a dataset to learn patterns and make predictions. In the context of movie recommendations, we can use k-NN to find the similar movies that users have liked in the past. This can help users find new movies that they might like. \n\nTo implement k-NN in R, we can use the kNN package which allows us to perform the algorithm on our dataset. We can specify the similarity metric as well as the distance measure to define the similarity between the movies. \n\nTo use k-NN with Cosine Similarity in R and Neo4j, we can use the neo4j package to perform the database queries. We can first create a database of movies and their ratings using the 'mymovies' dataset. \n\nThen, we can use the 'kNN' dataset in the knn package to perform the algorithm on the dataset. The 'mymovies' dataset can be used as the dataset for the algorithm, where the ratings can be represented as the 'ratings' column. \n\nWe can use the 'mymovies' dataset as a dataset for the KNN algorithm. We can also use the 'ratings' dataset as the dataset for the Cosine Similarity calculation. \n\nFinally, we can visualize the results using the 'ggplot2' package to create a network visualization of the recommendations. \n\nI hope this helps users find new movies to watch!<|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "Great! Using movie recommendations with k-nearest neighbors and cosine similarity in R and Neo4j can be a fun and interesting project. Here are some steps to get you started:\n\n1. Collect and preprocess your movie dataset: You'll need a dataset of movies with relevant features such as title, genre, year released, etc. Preprocess the data by converting categorical variables into numerical vectors using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n2. Create a graph in Neo4j: A graph is an excellent choice for storing and querying movie recommendations. Each node in the graph represents a movie, and edges connect movies that are similar. Use Cypher queries to create nodes and edges based on your dataset.\n3. Implement k-nearest neighbors algorithm in R: Use the distance matrix of your movie features to calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of movies. Find the k most similar movies for a given movie using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.\n4. Generate movie recommendations: Use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to find the top N movies that are most similar to a given movie. You can then use these movies as recommendations for users who like that movie.\n5. Visualize your results: Use visualization tools in R or Neo4j to visualize the connections between movies and the similarity between them. This will help you identify trends and patterns in your dataset and improve your recommendation algorithm.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point, and there are many ways to improve and optimize your movie recommendation system. Have fun experimenting with different techniques and algorithms!"

            "There's currently a very wide range of careers in which do data analysis, and it's in part complicated because the kind of path stratification that say, the medical profession has is still on-going in the data world. On the \"lighter\" end there are folks who work in business intelligence, which simply produces summary statistics for companies (e.g. how many people bought X in January 2014?). The middle end has folks (like me) who can not only manipulate datasets, but build relatively complex predictive or causal models (and, to brag a bit, already bamboozle your average Fortune 500 company). On the heavy end, there are data science guys with PhDs in fancy things like machine learning, often with complementary undergrad degrees in compsci, doing insane things at Google, Target, etc. So the field is very, very broad (especially in terms of how much compsci you're expected to bring along versus pure statistical programs). It kind of depends what your appetite for coding/modeling is. Just my two cents, but I also suspect that data visualization will fork off from data science in a bit. They converge in terms of output (amazing analysis that laypeople can understand!) but don't have much in common in terms of the skill set - it's like a programming vs visual design thing.\n\nTake a look at Kaggle.com - it's a good place for newer folks to get a feel for the moderate to heavy end of the spectrum, and they have a jobs part of the site too.\n\nNot sure about solo freelance work, but I work for a consulting firm that essentially does data science for folks.

While there are certainly tasks within data science that can be automated or outsourced, the value lies in the ability to ask the right questions, interpret the results, and apply them to business problems. This requires a deep understanding of both the technical aspects of data analysis and the specific industry or domain being analyzed. Therefore, while some parts of data science may become commoditized, the true value will continue to come from experts who can provide insightful analysis and actionable recommendations based on their expertise and experience.",
        "faclon_response": "Data science is a field of study that uses scientific techniques, processes, and algorithms to uncover insights in data. It is becoming increasingly popular in industries such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. Data science has the potential to become commoditized, meaning it can be easily replicated and offered for a lower cost. However, to prevent this from happening, it is important to emphasize the value that data science can bring to organizations, and to maintain the quality of data science services. Companies should focus on building unique and specialized data science services to remain competitive in a commoditized world. By creating a range of specialized data science services, companies can differentiate themselves from their competitors and maintain their position in the market. Additionally, data science teams should strive to stay up-to-date with new technologies and algorithms in order to remain competitive and continue to offer valuable insights. This can involve attending industry conferences, staying active in online communities, and regularly investing in professional development to keep employees up-to-date with the latest trends.<|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "Commoditization of data science is a topic of much debate. While it's possible that some aspects of data science could become more accessible and affordable through automation and off-the-shelf solutions, the complex and interdisciplinary nature of data science makes it unlikely to be fully commoditized anytime soon.\n\nData science involves working with large datasets, applying statistical models, and developing predictive algorithms. These tasks require a combination of technical expertise, domain knowledge, and critical thinking skills. Automating certain tasks through machine learning or artificial intelligence can certainly reduce costs, but it may not eliminate the need for human data scientists altogether.\n\nMoreover, as data becomes increasingly important in decision-making across various industries, there will be a growing demand for skilled professionals who can work with complex data sets and extract meaningful insights. This demand is unlikely to be met by automation alone, and will continue to drive the need for human data scientists.\n\nIn summary, while some aspects of data science may become more accessible and affordable through automation, it is unlikely that the field as a whole will be commoditized anytime soon due to its complex and interdisciplinary nature."

I guess you could say I was massaging the data.  ATLAS data is stored on an event by event basis, and an analysis involves making a bunch of selection choices to only get the events you want, we use monte carlo simulations to decide if our choices are good enough (this sentence makes it sound way easier than it actually is).  This is done on petabytes of data on computers all around the world, so it is definitely an example of big data in science.\n\nI don't know if I can afford to be jobless for 6 months, being a grad student has taken its toll on my finances.

            "When I was in a similar situation I read many sources and found that between 2 and 3 times your full-time hourly rate is a fair price. It sounded like a lot to me at the time but it is not that much when you consider how much large consulting companies charge to their clients.",
            "Definitely charge more than your current salary, as consultants have to pay higher taxes and have other expenses. Starting data scientists make 90-110K/year so charging between 50-80 dollars and hour is probably reasonable.",
            "Also due to the variability of the work.  If you're working for a month and then need to find work for a month, you've got to make the numbers add up.",

I would suggest, as it was to me, to put the compensation in the statement of work so it can be amended without changing the contract.  You can renegotiate terms if the scope changes. Best of luck.

I consult for the Department of Defense in the Washington DC area, and I guarantee the rates there are much, much higher than, say, Memphis, TN or Lincoln, NE.\n\nSecond, as someone mentioned, you need to factor in stuff like retirement, health care, administrative fees, etc. A good rule of thumb I've always found is take an annual before-tax salary you might expect to make in a W-2 world and add at least 80% of it to get a 1099 gross (but see #1...that's my DC norm).\n\nGood luck.

            "That last point is key: don't underprice yourself, even if you end up charging less. You cost more, but give a discount (or not). That original higher price anchors the value in the customers mind and also sets the stage for future contracts at that price.",
            "Chicago area, with 10 years experience, consulting for a large company, I'd expect to get $150. 2 years experience... $100 - $120, probably depends on if they value your PhD or just want a code monkey. Set up a corporation to receive your funds, you'll probably need insurance, which is all fairly cheap. But, if it's a pure consulting thing, expect to be doing travel, hand-holding, sales, marketing, accounting, billing, etc. just as much as actual data science work. ",

Just make sure to factor in the time to service the monthly work when scheduling new work. They always seem to have an emergency during the busiest time of new projects.\n\nAlso, be strict about not working beyond the hours that the monthly fee pays for (unless you're fixing up a mistake of yours), otherwise you can end up working for free. And get absolutely everything in writing and signed off by the client. I'm only 6 months into the consulting gig and learning all this stuff the hard way. I had a client in tears today because I didn't set those boundaries when I first started and I don't have the time she has come to expect for me to devote these days. It is horrible for everyone.",
            "$5K isn't much. Maybe a week worth of work. But great supplemental income. Just make sure you protect yourself against that project becoming more than 5 - 7 days of work a month. It'll eat into the time you could be billing elsewhere.",
            "I know this is old now, but I'm sure you could use the support.  In my kind of consulting I do not do retainers I do payments in advance with consideration given for the advance.   So If I'm normally $500/hr, they can get me for $300/hr if they agree to a 40 hour block.   They can only get the $300/hr IF they pay-up front.  I use my accounting package (FreshBooks) to track the credit, and invoice them using the balance from the credit. I invoice weekly, so my customers always know what I worked on recently and how much they have left over.\n\nEverything is billable hour, (Time and Materials) nothing is project based.  Especially with working with unknown outcome, you could have to sign with a company to clean up some data for you before you could do the work, or blow a budget out because the data you end up getting from them is so poor. Whatever, or they decide they want you to focus on something else.\n\nMake sure you spend your time doing customer work and looking for new work. You want to make sure you are comfortable.",

The company I was working for got bought out and as a \"good gesture\" they wanted to pay me $20/hr as a transition consultant. I left that place as soon as I found a better offer (unsolicited).  Working full-time for about a year and a half I wanted to return towards my education again. I needed to earn about the same amount in less time, hey $70/hr as a Jr IT Consultant for an MSP.  Since then I got into more Accounting/ERP related consulting and my hourly is between $200-400/hr.  I'll say that much.  I give discounts to customers that are willing to commit to a pre-payment and the guaranteed workload.  My rule since that $20/hr \"consulting\" job is to value myself more.

This can range from $50 to $200 or more per hour, depending on the complexity of the project and the level of involvement required.\n* Project-based fees: Consider charging a flat fee for a specific project, based on the scope of work involved. This can be a good option if you have a clear understanding of the project requirements and can estimate the time involved accurately.\n* Retainer fees: Offer a retainer service where you charge a set amount per month for a specified level of consulting services.

They help to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in large datasets by using various data mining techniques such as clustering, association rule mining, and anomaly detection. These maps can be interactive, allowing users to explore the data further by drilling down into specific areas or filtering the results based on certain criteria.\n\nTo create a data mining map, you first need to preprocess and analyze your data using appropriate tools and algorithms. Once you have extracted meaningful insights from the data, you can represent them visually on a map using various chart types such as scatter plots, heat maps, or choropleth maps. The choice of chart type depends on the nature of the data and the insights you want to convey.\n\nData mining maps are useful for exploring large and complex datasets, identifying hidden patterns, and gaining new insights into your data. They can be used in various industries such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and logistics to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.",
        "faclon_response": "Data mining is an important technique used in machine learning and AI. It involves extracting patterns from large datasets and using them to gain insights and make predictions. \n\nOne common method used in data mining is mapping, where data is mapped to a geographic area to visualize and analyze the distribution of specific data points. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as analyzing population demographics, determining the most efficient delivery routes for a business, or identifying the best locations to open a new store.\n\nThe map generated from data mining can provide valuable insights into the data and can be used to make better decisions. It is important to choose the right visualization tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data. For example, clustering can be used to identify groups of data points that are related, and color coding can be used to identify trends.\n\nThe use of data mining in maps can also help uncover unexpected patterns or insights in data. By using advanced algorithms and techniques, it is possible to make more complex predictions and extract insights from data that might not be obvious at a glance.\n\nData mining map can be a valuable tool for businesses and organizations.

Here's the link: http://www.hilarymason.com/presentations-2/in-search-of-the-optimal-cheeseburger/\n\nMy experience in bringing data science to non-technical people is mostly about making it accessible in the beginning. If you have ongoing 30 minute sessions, start with an overview of a fun and engaging project, and then in subsequent sessions drill down into the steps and parts that made it possible. In doing this, you can simultaneously draw parallels to your own business. This has been a good approach for me because it's given me context in which to discuss important concepts like clustering and classification, but the context remains light and fun.

As I develop my data science projects mainly at home in two different computers but from time to time I add a bit of code at work, I use git and push to a private repository in [BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org).\n\nI tend to use tags when developing different models. When I get better performance on a given algorithm, I push to the repository along with a tag that contains the score for whatever error metric I am using. That way, I can easily see which modifications caused how much improvement.",
            "Thanks. I assume asking on reddit adds a strong bias... And maybe people not using versionning don't want to comment. What would be your ball park estimate of the use of git among datascientists you know?",
            "I do not know enough data scientists to give a significant answer. Mostly, I collaborate with others in Kaggle competitions, and in that context using some kind of version control mechanism is mandatory. I don't know what they do in their daily practice, sorry.",
            "I work on a data science team for a startup, and we use git.  We also do code reviews among other data scientists using pull requests in github.  We do these for software/apps, SQL queries for data pulls for internal and external customers, and algorithms that we build.\n\nPersonally, I haven't use git a ton in the past... but, then I started noticing that I either have hundreds of files with various iterations of projects, or I can never 100% replicate the work that I've done because there's also some small formatting change or something that I forget.  Version control has pretty much solved this problem for me :)",
            "You bet yer ass. One really nice feature of version control is that you can reproduce your results. If you know what version of your code produced any result set, you don't ever have to worry about how you got that data. Every time you wiggle a parameter, check that code in. ",

I just started learning Git this weekend and I'm already wondering how I lived without it before. I've been using the Git bash command line and the built in RStudio stuff and both are great. \nWorkflow:\n\nInitialize a project\n\nAdd some files to it from a folder of stock code that I keep (basically templates I've made for the kind of projects I typically do)\n\nPush the \"initial commit\"\n\nMake changes\n\nCommit, push\n\n(If I work for an hour and don't make any significant changes or I'm half way through making a noteworthy change, I don't commit. If I work for 6 hours and I make 2 or 3 noteworthy changes, I commit as I go, making 2 or 3 commits in 6 hours.)\n\nIf I want to try something \"experimental\" or potentially risky, I branch.\n\nIf I decide that I hate it or I get frustrated and give up, I switch back to the master branch and forget about that experimental branch. If it works out, I merge it back in with the master branch. \n\nI haven't used it for collaboration yet, but I can envision about 100 ways Git would make that easier.\n\nIs it overkill?\n\nHell no. It's glorious. Spend 2 hours today messing with it and watching \"Intro to Git\" videos on YouTube and add a sweet new line to your resume for good. Get it set up, learn to commit, push, and pull. Figure out anything more advanced as you go. Honestly the amount of productivity/safety/organization you'll gain from just getting the basics is worth wayyyy more than the initial 2 hour time commitment. Do it ASAP.\n\n**Edit:** better spacing",

Version control is dead-stupid simple. If you're bright enough to write an ensemble classifier, you should be able to do something as simple as check in your code revisions. \n\nBut the advantages are just enormous. It's a necessary tool for a professional. To the point where I would say if you're not using it, you're at best making life hard on yourself and everyone else. And at worst, you're going to end up in serious trouble. \n\nIf someone comes to you and says: \"Hey, remember the results you gave us a month ago? We need that again.\" You can't say it's not possible because the model has changed since then. If you've been using VC, it's trivial to figure out exactly the state of the model you were using to produce that data. If you weren't it's likely going to be nearly impossible.  \n\nIf you work with other data scientists or you might in the future, they're going to need to know how you did what you did. VC is the very best way to share code because you're sharing living code with them, not just the snapshot you took the moment you emailed them a copy of your code. \n\nIf you ever leave the company, or just go on vacation, they have to be able to keep thing running without you. So your work better be available. \n\nVC keeps your code in sync between your laptop and any production servers running your code. It's a more reliable backup than anything else you're using (do you really copy your work to Dropbox every half hour or so?). \n\nIf you're interacting with software developers (and if you're a data scientist, you almost certainly are) this is where the whole system lives.

            "It depends on what you want.  If you want to learn how to \"do\" data science, as in take a data set, clean it up, and use various techniques to extract useful information from it, the learn-by-doing approach will probably work just fine up to a point. If you want to do research or development, though, this won't get you very far.  \n\nI'd encourage you to try and pick up some of the maths as you go, since that will go a long way towards knowing what techniques are useful in which cases, and it'll be mandatory if you ever need to tweak other people's work towards peculiarities in whatever odd data set you end up working on.\n\nBut for the short term, grab a copy of SKlearn (or something similar), and work through their examples, then go grab some data that looks workable from the UC Irvine data repository, and try them out on that.

So I was wondering if it was affordable to learn datascience by making one thing at a time. I've read on several blogs people using just one or two algorithms to make awesome things (like hacking flappy birds to dodge pipes forever).  \nI was thinking of picking small interesting projects (there are many in my notes which I want to make once I become a good data-scientist), asking community of experts (you guys) about how to take on that problem, which algorithms to use etc, and then learn those algorithms enough to implement the solution, and iterate.

As an AI assistant, I can offer a few suggestions to help you get started with machine learning: \n\nFirst, it is important to understand the fundamentals of machine learning and data analytics. There are many great resources available online to learn about these topics. Some good starting points include the book \"Data Science from Scratch\" by Joel Grus, and online courses offered by Coursera and edX.\n\nSecond, it is essential to understand the concept of supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves training a model to make predictions on new data. This requires labeled training data, and the model will learn the patterns in the data over time. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves learning the structure of the data without labels. This is useful for clustering and finding patterns in the data.\n\nThirdly, it is essential to find the right dataset to practice on. There are many open datasets available online that you can use as practice datasets to get a better understanding of machine learning. You can also look at Kaggle, which is a great resource for finding datasets and practicing your skills.\n\nFinally, practice is key. It is essential to work through problems, and to try different approaches to find the best solution.

This joint degree idea is interesting -- I've never heard of something like that, though I just checked and apparently my school does something similar.\n\nIn general, IS is specifically domain-free. What you learn about info architecture, databases, and research software will be equally applicable to almost all real world situations.\n\nThat said, just because you learn the bits that apply everywhere doesn't mean there aren't also pieces that are specific to your interests in Latin America. Language, historical and sociological circumstances, and the needs of the people there will all affect the design and use of the technology you work on.\n\nI've heard IS described as \"computer science for humanities majors.\" That seems to be the case for you. As a humanities major who got a masters in IS and then tried to get a job, I know firsthand that we're competing for technology positions with CS students who just have more experience in the tech than we do. The more you can bring to the table besides just hardcore technical knowledge, the more you will stand out from the zillions of people who _also_ know SQL, XML, etc. For example, if you're into IA and know about Latin America you might be a good fit for a UX localization project for Google or some other international brand. So, if you're passionate about the Latin America stuff, and don't mind being in school that much longer, I can see it coming in handy, but only for a very specific niche of jobs. The hard part in putting it to use will be tracking down those information jobs that it is actually relevant for. But if you can find them, I imagine the employers will be psyched to have someone who can connect the dots between the technology and its use.\n\n(I also just have to throw out there that, regardless of whether it will _help_ you, having an MA in Latin American studies certainly won't _hurt_ you. If you're really passionate about it and would love to study it even if it doesn't directly advance your career, what better time to get that degree than when you're planning to be in school anyway? It's much easier to keep the grad school train rolling once you're entrenched in it than it is to go back to it after you've left. I actually think this is the most compelling argument to get that degree -- you're going to be in school, you love the subject, so go for it!)\n\nAs far as research goes, I don't want to discourage you -- you're in a different subset of IS than me, so it might be different for you -- but I found that a masters wasn't enough to get me access to the types of research positions I was interested in. That's why I'm now back in school getting a PhD!\n\nIf you have any more questions, about IS or grad school generally, I'm happy to help! I'm pretty excited to see information science show up on reddit!",
            "Thanks a ton for the reply. I've been thinking, and I really have only two major concerns:\n\n1. Looking at the classes for the double major, it looks like I am able to take less electives in IS than if I just did IS. That worries me as I don't want to miss out on the valuable experience. Perhaps this is incorrect and I'll be able to confirm with the programs as I continue conversations with them.\n\n2. I think that I do want to go on to a PhD in the future in IS. As a humanities major, I fully understand the need of the terminal degree to do high end research. One of my professors told me that getting a dual degree would cause potential PhD programs to \"question my focus\" and that I should just do one. \n\nEDIT: Also, do you have any recommendations as to the kind of technical skills that I could start building now to make myself more competitive in the field? My last semester is a little lax now that my capstone thesis is finished, and I'd like to fill the next 6 months before the program starts doing something productive.\nAgain, thanks for the reply. You've been extremely helpful!\n",
            "You're very welcome!\n\n1. This is hard for me to speak to. As you said, the people there will be able to help you figure this out. If it does turn out that the joint degree means you lose out on good stuff, [this page](http://www.indiana.edu/~clacs/academics/graduate/dual-degrees/) indicates it's only 12 more credits (so, a semester) to do the degrees separately, so you could conceivably get two degrees instead of the joint degree.\n\n2. I don't really buy this. My school just interviewed a prospective faculty member who has an MS in economics, an MS and PhD in statistics, and a Master of Legal Studies. Crazy number of degrees, but the point is that no one had any concerns about her focus. Just glancing through some random faculty at Indiana, I found someone with an MS and PhD in instructional technology and an MS in educational psychology; and someone else with an MA and PhD in English (again, at the information science school). This is a really interdisciplinary field, and diverse backgrounds are, in my experience, cause for celebration, not concern.\n\n3. If your program is like mine, they won't assume any background knowledge, so anything you do ahead of time will be to make things easier to understand when you are ultimately taught them in class. I'd say the best all-purpose tools are programming and statistics. Having prior exposure to e.g. [Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) and/or [statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/) will allow you to get more out of those classes, because you'll be able to work on understanding things more deeply rather than just keeping up.\n\nI'd be interested to hear what other data scientists in this sub have to say about things to study before starting grad school.",
            "Sweet, this is all making me feel much better. I thought that applying would be the most stressful part of the process. Unfortunately funding wasn't available for the LAS department, but I'm still waiting to hear if I qualified for a scholarship from the IS department. \n\nEven if I don't get funding the first year, I feel more comfortable taking out a reasonable amount in loans considering that I'm graduating undergrad with no debt.\n\nAlso, I'll check out Python, and I'm in stats now.\n\nThanks!",

        "mistral_response": "The formula used by governments to measure poverty often dates back to when a loaf of bread cost only 22 cents. However, this outdated measure fails to take into account the realities of today's economy. Inflation, changing consumer needs, and increased costs of living have all contributed to underestimating the number of people living in poverty.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture, governments should consider using alternative methods such as the Food Prices and Nutrition Survey or the Cost of Basic Needs Basket approach. These methods provide a more comprehensive measure of what it takes to live decently, considering factors like food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\nMoreover, governments must update their poverty line regularly to reflect changing economic conditions and consumer needs. This will result in a more accurate assessment of the true extent of poverty within a society and enable better policies to uplift those who are struggling.",
        "faclon_response": "In this day and age, it is hard to imagine that anyone in this country would be unable to afford a decent meal. Yet, despite the wealth and resources this country has to offer, there are still many people who struggle to make ends meet. This issue is not unique to the United States - in fact, it is a common problem all over the world. \n\nWhen it comes to poverty, however, the issue is often hidden away. The government often uses formulas and statistics that have been outdated for decades, which may not accurately reflect the current economic climate. In order to better understand the issue of poverty in this country, it is important to look at more than just one aspect of a person's life. \n\nThe cost of living is rising, and wages are not keeping up. For example, in 1950, a loaf of bread cost 22 cents - yet today, it costs over $4. If we were to adjust for inflation, it would cost over $10. This means that the average wage today is significantly less than it was in the past. As a result, people who are struggling to make ends meet have a harder time keeping up with rising costs. \n\nIt is also important to recognize that poverty is not just an issue of income, but of access to resources. In many cases, people who are struggling financially may also have limited access to education, health care, and other essential services. It is also important to look at the issue of social mobility in this country - those who are born into poverty may have a harder time breaking out of it due to limited opportunities.\n\nPoverty is not just a problem in this country - it is a global issue. While there are many resources available in this country to help those who are struggling, it is important to look at the root causes of poverty, and the systemic issues that contribute to its persistence. With greater understanding, we can work towards solving this issue in the long run.\nUser <|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "The formula used to measure poverty in the United States, which dates back to when a loaf of bread cost 22 cents, may not accurately reflect the true cost of living today. The government's official poverty line, which is based on a fixed dollar amount, does not take into account the rising costs of essentials such as housing, healthcare, and education. As a result, many people who are struggling to make ends meet may not be considered poor according to this measure, despite living in poverty. Additionally, the formula does not account for geographic differences in the cost of living, meaning that someone living in an area with a high cost of living may be considered poor even if they do not meet the official poverty line. To get a more accurate picture of poverty, it is important to use a more comprehensive measure that takes into account the true costs of living and geographic differences."

It also made the computer less intimidating to use, making it accessible to a wider audience.\n\nIn terms of software subroutines, one that has made an enormous impact is the programming language known as C++. This language has been widely used in the creation of complex software applications, such as video games and database management systems. It also allows for the creation of powerful tools and utilities, such as compilers and debuggers.\n\nOverall, the greatest software subroutine ever created likely depends on the specific task or application you are looking to use it for. With such a wide range of options, it can be difficult to choose one. However, there are certainly many great options out there that can help you complete complex tasks with ease.\nUser <|endoftext|>",

We’ll be analyzing the data to find out which movies are most popular, and why they became so successful. \n\nFirst, let’s look at some of the more popular movies and the factors that contributed to their success. Movies with a large viewership have the ability to generate significant profits, as more people watching means more money being made. This is especially true of blockbuster movies, as they are able to generate massive profits from their wide release. \n\nFor example, Avengers: Endgame, the highest grossing movie of all time, was able to make over $2 billion worldwide due in part to its wide release and large viewership. Movies with a large viewership also have the advantage of being able to get more buzz and word of mouth marketing, as more people watching the movie means more people discussing it with others.\n\nAnother factor in determining the popularity of a movie is its cast. Many movies with well-known actors have higher viewership and larger profits, as audiences are more likely to see a movie with familiar faces. \n\nFor example, Avengers: Endgame was able to generate such high profits due to its well-known cast and actors, including Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, and Mark Ruffalo. \n\nFinally, marketing and advertising are an essential part of any blockbuster movie’s success. Many of these movies spend a lot of money on marketing and advertising to generate buzz and drive word of mouth. \n\nFor example, Avengers: Endgame spent a significant amount on marketing, including billboards, radio ads, and online campaigns. This marketing campaign was able to generate a lot of buzz for the movie, helping to drive its box office success. \n\nOverall, while there are many factors that contribute to a movie’s success, its viewership and marketing are key factors in determining its profitability. Movies with large viewership and well-known actors have the advantage of being able to generate significant profits, while spending a lot on marketing can also help to drive word of mouth and increase profitability. \n\nWith this in mind, it is no surprise that movies with well-known actors and a large viewership tend to be the most profitable. After all, it takes more than just a good story to generate significant profits – it takes a lot of hard work, marketing, and a large viewership.\nUser <|endoftext|>",

        ],
        "mistral_response": "Recursion and machine learning are fundamentally different concepts. Recursive functions, such as the Fibonacci sequence, are a way to define functions in mathematics where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. Machine learning structures, on the other hand, learn patterns from data and make predictions based on that learned pattern.\n\nWhile there have been attempts to implement recursion in neural networks through techniques like recursive neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, these models do not perfectly emulate recursive functions in the same way that a traditional recursive function does. Instead, they learn the patterns of recursion from data and generate outputs based on those learned patterns.\n\nTherefore, while machine learning structures can approximate the behavior of recursive functions, especially for simple sequences like Fibonacci, they do not perfectly emulate them due to their fundamentally different nature. For more complex recursive functions or large datasets, machine learning models may be a better choice over traditional recursion due to their ability to learn and generalize patterns from data.",
        "faclon_response": "This is a great question! While recursive functions can be an elegant solution to a problem, they are not always the most efficient or scalable way of solving it. Machine learning can often provide an elegant solution to complex problems, but it is not always the best fit for a recursive function.\n\nOne example of a recursive function that can be solved using machine learning is the Fibonacci sequence. It is a simple problem that has been studied extensively in mathematics and computer science, and has been shown to have some interesting applications in various fields.\n\nWhile there are machine learning algorithms that can be used to emulate the Fibonacci sequence, they may not always be the best fit. One issue with using machine learning for a recursive function is that the algorithms may become increasingly complex and require more computational resources as the number of recursive calls increases. Additionally, some problems may require a higher degree of precision than can be achieved using machine learning.\n\nIn summary, while machine learning can be an elegant solution to many problems, it is not always the best fit for recursive functions. The Fibonacci sequence is a simple problem with interesting applications that can be solved using existing machine learning algorithms, but it may not be the most efficient solution in all cases.\nUser <|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "Thank you for your question! While it's theoretically possible to create a machine learning model that can approximate the Fibonacci sequence, there are several reasons why an existing structure cannot perfectly emulate it.\n\nFirstly, the Fibonacci sequence is inherently non-linear and exhibits self-similarity, which makes it challenging to model using traditional machine learning techniques. Secondly, the sequence has a recursive structure that is difficult to capture with a single neural network or other ML model. Finally, the Fibonacci sequence has a finite number of terms, which limits the complexity of the ML model.\n\nWhile there are some recent advances in ML research that can approximate recursive functions using techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Structured Perceptrons (SP), these models are still in their early stages of development. It's likely that a custom-designed ML model will be required to accurately emulate the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nIn summary, while existing machine learning structures can provide a good approximation of the Fibonacci sequence, they cannot perfectly emulate it due to the inherent challenges in modeling non-linear, self-similar functions with ML techniques."

GAMs were originally developed by [Trevor Hastie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Hastie) and [Robert Tibshirani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tibshirani)  to blend properties of [generalized linear models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) with [additive models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_model).\n\n&gt;The model relates a univariate response variable, *Y*, to some predictor variables, *x**i*. An [exponential family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family) distribution is specified for Y (for example [normal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), [binomial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) or [Poisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) distributions) along with a link function *g* (for example the identity or log functions) relating the expected value of *Y* to the predictor variables via a structure such as\n\n&gt;The functions *f**i*(*x**i*) may be functions with a specified parametric form (for example a polynomial, or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable) or maybe specified non-parametrically, or semi-parametrically, simply as 'smooth functions', to be estimated by [non-parametric means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_regression). So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function, such as a locally weighted mean, for *f*1(*x*1), and then use a factor model for *f*2(*x*2).

Additionally, big data can be difficult to process due to the sheer size and complexity of it.\n\nIt is important to always remember that there is a reason why certain data was collected. In big data, this can be especially important. Depending on the project and the goals, different types of data may need to be collected in order to achieve success. This can be done by leveraging existing data or by collecting new data that can be used to supplement existing data. \n\nWhen working with big data, it is important to keep in mind that there are certain data collection techniques that are more effective than others. For example, data can be collected in a variety of ways, including online surveys, customer support tickets, or even credit card transactions. Ultimately, the most important thing to remember is that big data should be collected with a specific purpose in mind. \n\nUltimately, big data can be incredibly helpful in data science projects. However, it is important to always keep in mind that data should be collected in a way that is tailored to the project’s goals. This will ensure that the data collected is of the highest quality and can be utilized to make the most of any insights gained. \n\nIn short, big data is an incredibly powerful tool, but it is important to keep in mind that data should be collected in a way that is tailored to the project’s goals. By doing this, you can be sure that the data will be as valuable and as accurate as possible.\nUser <|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "Ah, an intriguing question! While Big Data has revolutionized the way we analyze and understand complex phenomena, it's important to recognize that data alone cannot provide all the answers. In fact, relying solely on Big Data can lead to shallow insights and a narrow perspective if not properly contextualized with other forms of knowledge.\n\nTo avoid falling into the trap of \"pretty darn dumb\" Big Data, it's essential to integrate it with other sources of information, such as expertise from domain-specific disciplines, cultural context, and human intuition. By combining these diverse perspectives, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand and make more informed decisions.\n\nIn summary, while Big Data is a powerful tool, it should be viewed as just one piece of the puzzle. By incorporating multiple viewpoints and approaches, we can create a more holistic and accurate picture of the world around us."

In the context of forecasting, an HMM can be seen as a dynamic system whose internal states generate observable outcomes with certain probabilities.\n\nThe Baum-Welch algorithm is an expectation-maximization (EM) method that iteratively improves the parameter estimates of an HMM to better fit observed data. It does this by first performing the Baum-Welch forward-backward pass, which calculates the probability of each state at each time step given the observed data and current model parameters. Then, it performs the Baum-Welch reestimation step, where the new parameter estimates are derived based on these probabilities.\n\nThese steps are repeated until convergence is achieved, resulting in improved model parameters that more accurately represent the relationships between states and observable outcomes in your data. Once this training process is complete, the HMM can be used to forecast future outcomes by calculating the probability distribution over possible states given the current observed sequence and the learned model parameters.",
        "faclon_response": "The Baum-Welch Algorithm and Hidden Markov Models are powerful tools used in predictive modeling and time series analysis. When used together, they can be used to generate forecasts and detect patterns in data. \n\nTo get started, you’ll need to understand how the Baum-Welch Algorithm works. It is a supervised learning method that uses Hidden Markov Models to learn the probability distribution of a time series and generate forecasts. To use it, you first need to specify the states and transitions of the hidden Markov model. You then split the time series into training and testing sets and use the Baum-Welch algorithm to learn the model and generate forecasts. Finally, you can use the forecasts to make better predictions.\n\nFor example, you might use the Baum-Welch algorithm to predict the stock prices of an asset like Apple. You could start by specifying the states of the hidden Markov model as “Up” and “Down.” You would then split the data into training and testing sets, and use the Baum-Welch algorithm to learn the model. Once it is learned, you can use the forecasted prices to make better investment decisions.\n\nSimilarly, you could use Hidden Markov Models to predict the sales of a product for a set of different categories. By specifying different categories and their associated states and transitions, you can learn the probability distribution of each category and generate forecasts for them.\n\nIn short, the Baum-Welch Algorithm and Hidden Markov Models are powerful tools that can be used to generate accurate forecasts from time series data. By using them in combination, you can make better predictions and take better investment decisions.<|endoftext|>",

They consist of a set of states, from which observations are generated according to certain probability distributions. The Baum-Welch algorithm can be used to estimate the parameters of an HMM given a set of observations.\n\nThe advantages of using the Baum-Welch algorithm for forecasting include its ability to handle complex models and large datasets, as well as its robustness to noise and missing data. However, it may not perform as well as other methods in certain situations, such as when the model is highly non-linear or when there are severe errors in the observations.\n\nIn summary, the Baum-Welch algorithm and HMMs are powerful tools for forecasting that can handle complex systems and large datasets.

Assuming you are not insanely good at it (i.e. you do a meta-analysis of 20 studies for breakfast), then you should probably learn some Bayesian inferential statistics and some machine learning as well.\n\n\n&gt; What resources should I use for learning? \n\n\nI liked the AI/robotics classes by Sebastian Thrun (now hosted on udacity). Bayesian statistics and inference in general crop up a lot, so that these courses should give you a feel what type of questions can be answered from this 'angle'. The machine learning class by Sebastian Seung on coursera is legendary, and hence after that course you similarly should know what type of questions can be tackled by machine learning techniques. Regarding more standard data crunching, there are a bunch of courses on coursera basically all the time; at this point, probably all are worth your time and effort.\n\n\n&gt; Which specific programming languages and data analysis programs are best to learn?\n\n\nLearn a programming language that is widely used and not a point-and-click exercise with a macro functionality as an afterthought. Python and its extensions for data analysis (numpy, scipy, pandas, and the scikit packages for analysis, matplotlib for visualisation) seem to have the most momentum at the moment. All of these are open source (i.e. free), easy to learn, quick to implement.

            "[deleted]",
            "And get a graduate degree.  The field is very new and most people won't take a chance with someone who has no graduate degree.  Go for statistics masters.\n\nSource: I am a data scientist\nEDIT: Graduate degree can me masters or PhD.  I only have masters in applied mathematics",
            "Did you work in the field as an analyst or something before going to grad school? I think I'd need to earn money before being able to afford grad school.",
            "You get paid to go to graduate school for science subjects (although a pittance).",
            "I believe that's only if you are pursuing a PhD not a masters. You would need to take out a loan for masters",
            "Data Analyst for 6 years here.  I've also taken the Intro to Data Science course on Coursera taught by Bill Howe from UW, and I'm familiar with the UW program you mentioned.  Here is my advice...I'll try to keep it brief:\n\n* Pure quantitative degrees are generally insufficient to get you a applied job out of school.  Sounds like you have the right idea in going after the Data Science certificate.  I looked at that specific program myself not long ago, but decided against it for reasons I will go into later.  If I were in your position, though (still an undergrad), I would definitely do it.\n* You will need to be strong in a number of fields, particularly a quantitative field (math/stat), computer science and business.  You should get most of this through your coursework.\n* Along with the computer science knowledge, learn a programming language.  I use SQL every day, and my current company uses SAS.  I am moving to a new company in a couple weeks where I will be using R instead of SAS.  It may also help to pick up a scripting language like Perl or Python.  If I were to start all over, I would learn SQL, R and Python in that order...however, this is mainly a matter of personal preference.\n* Learn how data is stored and accessed.  Again, this should come from your Data Science program.  Understand relational databases as well as \"big data\" methodologies (e.g. MapReduce).  I regret working so long at a company that doesn't utilize \"big data\"...I feel I'm behind the curve in that area now.\n* Once you start learning, start seeking out real data to work with. There many places to find real data for free (Quandl, data.gov, even other subreddits here). Find a topic that you care a lot about (one you might pursue a career in) and start a personal data analysis project.  This will not only get you practice and experience without having a job, but it can help a great deal in landing an interview.  It shows you are passionate enough about the subject matter to work on it in your free time...even more impressive if it contains thoughtful insight that the company hasn't thought of themselves.  If you just send out your resume with no job experience, no internships, and no personal passion projects, you're not going to get many responses.\n* Learn how to communicate your findings effectively.  This is a completely separate skill from the ones above, and equally (if not more) important.  You will be doing very detailed analyses, but communicating your analysis to people with much less information.  As such, you really need to structure your results in an intuitive manner, get down to the main points, and tell me a story with your data.  Finally, unless you're doing pure research, your analysis should be actionable (i.e. \"this analysis shows a clear opportunity we need to pursue here, and this is how\")\n\nI glossed over a lot of the details, but you will fill those in yourself as you learn about these topics and gain these skills.  Also, it's 1 a.m. and I am very tired :)\n\nFinally, this is my own personal opinion, but I don't think you need a graduate degree for this, especially if you can't afford it.  I have a B.S. in Math/Stat and have never had any problems getting interviews.  Yes, you can go to grad school for \"free\", or you can get a high-paying job with a bachelors and get an extra couple years of experience.  If you can't find a job right away, then you can think about grad school if that's what employers are telling you they need.  From my experience, employers want to hire someone that would do their job whether they are getting paid or not (e.g. If you want to get a job as a game designer, you should be making games in your free time).\n\nThe other reason I don't think you need grad school is because there are tons of free educational resources available to you to augment your undergrad coursework.  I am constantly enrolled in free online classes that will teach me the same thing I would get out of an university course, because these are often taught through reputable universities.  Check out Coursera.com, datacamp.com, kaggle.com, edx.org, and Stanford OpenEdX.  You will find plenty of resources to learn on your own time, for free.\n\nData Science has been around for ages, but it's really been popularized recently with the information revolution.  This means the modern field as it's now known is still young and becoming more competitive by the day.  I find it to be very fascinating and fulfilling...there's no shortage of interesting data out there.  Best of luck!",

I don't have time to tune models; I'm happy to punt a proof of concept to a dev.  I don't work in a world where people care about eeking out the last 5% of value.\n\nKnowing techniques is great; continue practicing!  You can add a lot of value with lower level techniques through an 80/20 approach.  Think about it; this country runs on Excel!\n\nThe beautiful thing (or annoying thing, depending on your skillset) is that there are a lot of soft skills needed to be an effective analyst.  Or there are at my place of work.  Being able to explain things to a non-technical audience is a tough skill to learn outside of actual day-to-day work + experience.  Awesome analysis + no influencing skills = no action taken.\n\nTL;DR -- take Andrew Ng's Coursera course",
            "Did you have any experience before your first DA job?",
            "No. I have about 8 years of business analyst experience.  Above two skills are what I learned on last two years ",
            "Awesome and very informative reply! I am indeed currently taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning online course right now as well! If you don't mind my picking your brain a bit more,  What kind of experience/background did you have prior to your current gig and does age matter during hiring?  \n\nI ask because my own background is an AS in molecular biology/bioinformatics and a BS in Materials Engineering (basically chemistry and physics) currently in a process engineering role with no on the job software experience at 27 years of age.  I am learning all the data analysis skills at home (and with a meetup group) on my own time and it's both daunting and exciting how much new material I feel I need to conquer this year even though I was always very comfortable around computer technologies and academic programming tasks.  \n\nMy big goal projects are as many kaggle challenges as I can take between summer and the end of the year as well as an open source city data analysis project that I am volunteering in.  ",
            "I've done a variety of roles which weren't data intensive, but I cherry picked situations / projects and restructured my pitch in interviews to highlight what these people wanted.  This was my biggest edge, I front-loaded a TON of research, coffees with employees, etc for each job.  It's not efficient up front, but it got me my job now.\n\nThat's really why I believe in having a portfolio, or at least being able to explain incredibly well what your process is.\n\nTo hammer that home; I had about 4 years of corporate experience in jobs which were about 25% data intensive.  Age really doesn't matter.  At my job, we have archetypes of people who we hire (consulting, i-banking, etc), but you can always carve yourself out as an exception if you have the examples to back it up.  I'm proof of that.\n\nBest of luck.\n\n",

Regression analysis models the relationship between the outcome variable and both the treatment and confounding factors to estimate the causal effect while controlling for confounders. Difference-in-differences uses the difference in outcomes between treatment and control groups before and after the intervention to estimate the causal effect, adjusting for any trends or differences that existed prior to the intervention.\n\nThese methods help account for potential confounding factors by statistically adjusting for their effects on the outcome variable, thus providing more accurate estimates of the causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome.",

Randomization: Randomly assigning participants to different groups can help to control for any selection bias or chance differences in the sample. \n3. Independent Measures: In order to be able to isolate the effects of the treatment, the researcher should include a separate measure for a variable that is not related to the treatment to ensure that the results are not due to this variable. \n4. Comparing Multiple Groups: By comparing multiple groups and treatment conditions, the researcher can control for other variables that may be present in the study.\n5. Statistical Methods: Using statistical methods such as multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling can help to control for any potential confounding factors. \n\nOverall, controlling for confounding variables is important in order to gain valid and reliable results from a quasi-experimental design.<|endoftext|>",

Data Science is to a large extent machines learning and programming over massive data sets. You unfortunately don't seem to have strong skills or experience in any of those areas.\n\nData Science is to a large extend bottle necked by programming (and getting data but with big data those are related) and not machine learning or thinking through problems. If I hire a programmer and teach them machine learning then while they're learning they can still support the team by taking on some of the programming workload. If I hire even a PhD in statistics (or machine learning) then while they're learning programming I need to devote multiple people to support them. It just makes it a logistical nightmare unless the company is big enough and even then you only have a small % of such experts. And if the company is big enough they'll be looking for their ML and Data Science experts to have PhDs.\n\nThat isn't all bad, Data Analytics and Data Science are tied closely together at many companies. One of my coworkers started in Data Analytic and I'd have grabbed him for the Data Science team in a heartbeat if he wasn't so set on transitioning into pure software development. The trick however is that you need to find such a company and position because otherwise Data Analytic can be worse than useless.",

You might want to look at the data scientist job listings and make sure more of those keywords are in your resume (ex. machine learning vs. logistic regression)\n\nI have found that the best way to get a good job is to talk directly to the people who are doing the work without the HR filter.  The best advice would be to go to a meetup for R and get to know people.  Startups are desperate for people with data skills, in my last company that was the #1 issue with expansion.\n\nAlso, you might want to consider other self-promotion methods, like blogging and twitter.  Academic publishing is great, but not as accessible to the rest of the world.  It looks like you are a basketball fan, you might want to consider doing some writing on basketball analytics, which are pretty hot right now.\n\nOne last thing to consider.  A lot of the statisticians that I have worked with seem to expect the world to be delivered to them in pre-cleansed SAS datasets and they will deliver results at their leisure.  Data scientists seem to be a more scrappy bunch.\n\nTake a look at what you are sending out and think about it from the hiring managers point of view.

Make sure you're presenting the results in a way that's easy for non-experts to understand.\n6. Continuously refine and improve your analysis as you gather more data or uncover new insights.\n\nRemember, data analysis is an iterative process that requires patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to adapt as you go. By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to extracting valuable insights from your data."

        "responses": [
            "1. This is a great question and I wish I had a better answer because I was just recently validated by getting hired into my first position with the title \"data scientist.\" I think accepting that I should go to grad school was sort of a struggle. I had invested a lot of time and energy teaching myself data science topics, and just sort of stumbled on to a graduate program that really interested me. I realized if I was going to spend all this time and energy anyway, I should probably do it in a structured environment. I didn't have what I considered to be the background to apply, but I went for it and I got in. I'm glad I went for it because now I'm realizing that basically all the jobs I want require a graduate degree.\n\n2. Succeeding in a math/stats masters program with a background in philosophy was pretty cool.\n\n3. I've found that being able to find my own information when I need it has been tremendously useful. Getting involved on StackOverflow/CrossValidated, taking MOOCs, and when I can't find a satisfactory MOOC, digging through lecture notes I find by digging through the faculty webpage of a researcher who interests me have all been really important and helpful.\n\n4. Hmm.... certain MOOCs, grad school courses, and textbooks have turned out to be duds, but for the most part I'm sort of an information sponge.",
            "Thanks for the response! Some great insights here, and a cool background story. What was it about the *less* useful courses and textbooks that made them less useful? Do you have any ideas on how they could be improved?",
            "Let's see here:\n\n* I'm taking a course right now that everyone in the course hates for several reasons:\n\n  * The teacher is teaching below our level.\n  * He is teaching formulas and not concepts. As a consequence no one is really sure how we would apply anything we are learning outside of class.\n  * We aren't really being given any practical problems or applications. The most practical stuff he's giving us is related to physics (I'm complaining about PDEs right now).\n  * This teacher is teaching completely from provided lecture notes. We were required to purchase a textbook for this class, but we have had no assigned readings in it and I have no idea when I would ever reference the book. I don't know why I own this book.\n\n* Here are some complaints about another bad teacher I've got right now:\n\n  * She is trying to teach a math based class but is not comfortable with the math herself. That wouldn't be a huge problem if it weren't for the fact that she is unwilling to admit when she is wrong. On a regular basis I call her out in class and she *always* stands by her guns. I'll look it up later and see from several sources that she was wrong. If you are a teacher and you aren't sure of something: just admit you aren't sure and say you'll give a solid answer later. Don't lie to and misinform your students.\n  * I have received no graded assignments back from this teacher. I want to know how I did on my homework. Especially since assignments build on each other, if I do something wrong in an earlier assignment, it will affect my strategy in a later assignment.\n\n* Here're some about a teacher I took several years ago:\n\n  * It was clear we were not a priority to this professor. He was never prepared for class. He would invent the problems on the board and get really deep into them before realizing he had made a mistake and we would need to erase pages of notes to backtrack. It got to the point where I just stopped taking notes.\n\nSo those are my complaints about the shitty teachers/courses. So what has distinguished the good ones?\n\n* My favorite teachers always challenge the crap out of me. Their assignments leave me exhausted, but I feel incredibly accomplished after completing them.\n* The assignments usually have some \"real world\" component, maybe using real data or something like that. Something to make the assignment tangible and practical.\n* The assignments move past the lecture. I need to combine other things I've learned in earlier lectures and possibly other classes to tackle the project.\n\nI like being challenged. I *learn* from being challenged. A softball class creates softball students. Make me derive the loss function for separating hyperplanes. Make me code my nested gibbs/MCMC sampler from scratch. Make me figure out for myself that I need to include exception handling when I'm pulling down data from the web.",

            "Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani also have a free MOOC on statistical learning with R correlation which is a bit more math oriented than some of the other courses but a fine course none the less.  It is on Stanford OpenEdX - this course just ended but should be offered again: https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about \nIt is helpful to see how these different professors - Ng, Leek, Hastie/Tibshirani use the tools available to them and emphasize the same topics different ways.

            "&gt;Frankly, if I were in a hiring position...\n\nIs there any data to suggest that those in hiring positions take MOOCs into consideration at all? It's something I'm curious about. I've always considered the value of MOOCs is that they possibly give you the knowledge to get started on your own projects (Kaggle etc.), which you could use to demonstrate your expertise- not the courses themselves. If anyone's got any experience with employers on this I'd love to hear it.",
            "Anything you'd recommend for Statistics? ",
            "It all depends on what you put on your resume or what you discuss in your interviews. If it's not on your resume (or mentioned in interviews), it's not a point of consideration. I didn't put MOOCs on my resume for work, but I did put them on my application for grad school and they absolutely helped. But you certainly make a valid point.",
            "This one looks like it might be OK: https://www.coursera.org/course/apstat\n\nEDIT: translation: no, unfortunately I don't really have any solid recommendations for statistics. Which is really too bad, because this is a seriously important subject and there really ought to be a \"go-to\" MOOC for it. Maybe Kahn academy for the basics?",
            "I wish there was more training on leveraging parallel architecture. I have neither seen a MOOC nor been exposed to anything in my graduate degree that discussed CUDA coding at all, although this seems to be a critical consideration in deep learning. Similarly, MapReduce and the hadoop ecosystem seems like it could really merit its own class, but it gets treated as an after thought in a couple of survey subjects. I'd like to see a \"Hadoop Technologies\" MOOC. I think people would latch on to that.\n\nAlso, the NLP stuff I find online seems to be a bit basic and outdated. The MOOCs don't seem to be discussing the (probabilistic) generative models that are dominating the scene these days. I want to see some more contemporary/advanced NLP materials.\n\nI think something that might make for an interesting course just to garner interest in the topic would be a series on Kaggle solutions. Most of the solutions have been published in thorough treatments by their teams: I think it would be really interesting if a \"course\" selected a handful of kaggle projects, discussed their evolution, the design decisions that led to the final solutions, and then the final implementation of the solutions. One of the nice things about using Kaggle would be an excuse to discuss practical applications for cutting-edge algorithms.\n\nEDIT: Also, as /u/breadlust bore out, there aren't any good options for advanced probability/statistics courses. For instance, I have yet to see a MOOC on experiment design, or survey sampling, or in-depth (better yet: measure-theoretic) probability theory. I guess maybe the problem is that we have a good bit of graduate level computer science MOOCs with a data science bend available, but not so many graduate level MOOCs for data science with a math bend in the MOOC ecosystem.",

            "You're more likely to want to post this in something like /r/python. \n\nHaving said that, I suspect you're missing something. A 6GB response from an API call is essentially insane as it would require either a streaming JSON parser or a shitpile of RAM. I would be very, very surprised - even if you can somehow make the API return that volume of data - that the API is designed to be used that way. Streaming parsers exists (see ijson for python) but making them essentially required is ... odd. I'd really go look at that API again.\n\nEdit: Getting MySQL to handle terabytes with any kind of complex queries isn't going to be a walk in the park either.",
            "You probably want to use something like the binary hdf4 format for data sets of that size. "
        ],
        "mistral_response": "When dealing with large-scale JSON responses from APIs, it's essential to manage the data efficiently. Here are some tips for handling JSON responses effectively:\n\n1. Use a library or tool designed for parsing JSON: Libraries such as `json` in Python or `jsondotnet` in C# can parse JSON much faster than using regular expressions or manual string manipulation.\n2. Streaming the JSON response: Instead of loading the entire JSON response into memory, use streaming techniques to process the data as it comes in, piece by piece, reducing memory usage and improving performance. Many HTTP clients support streaming, like `StreamingContext` in C# or `iterparse()` in BeautifulSoup for Python.\n3. Use efficient data structures: Choose appropriate data structures for storing and processing the JSON data. For example, consider using dictionaries (Python), Hashtables (C#) or arrays instead of complex nested objects where possible.\n4. Parse only what you need: If you don't require all the data in a large JSON response, filter out unnecessary keys or values and parse only the required parts to reduce processing time and memory usage.\n5. Implement pagination or limit the number of items retrieved: When working with APIs that return vast amounts of data, consider implementing pagination techniques or limiting the number of items fetched in a single request. This way, you can process smaller chunks of data at a time.",
        "faclon_response": "Generating large scale JSON formatted API replies can be difficult, especially if the API endpoint is not well organized. Here are a few tips that can help simplify the process:\n\n1. Use pagination: If the API endpoint is returning a large number of results, it's best to use pagination to limit the number of results returned in each request. This will help reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server and improve performance.\n\n2. Use compression: Compressing data before sending it through APIs can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred. This can be done by compressing the data on the server before sending it back to the client, or by using compression algorithms on the client to reduce the size of the data being received.\n\n3. Use caching: Caching data can help reduce the number of API requests required to retrieve the same data. This can be achieved by storing frequently accessed data in a cache or by using a distributed caching system.\n\n4. Use a content delivery network (CDN): A CDN can help distribute content and reduce latency by storing and serving it from multiple locations around the world.\n\n5. Use a data feed: If the data being returned is structured and predictable, using a data feed can simplify the API response by reducing the number of API calls required to retrieve the data.\n\nOverall, using these tips can help simplify the API response and make it more efficient and less resource-intensive. With a little planning and attention to detail, generating a JSON formatted API response can be much less complicated than it may seem.<|endoftext|>",
        "llama2_response": "If you're experiencing issues with handling large-scale JSON-formatted API responses, there are several strategies you can employ to improve performance. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Use a streaming API: Instead of receiving the entire response at once, use a streaming API that delivers the data in small chunks. This can help reduce memory usage and improve performance.\n2. Buffer responses: Store the response in a buffer before processing it. This can help manage large responses and avoid running out of memory.\n3. Use a faster network connection: Ensure your application is connected to the internet via a fast and reliable network connection. This can help reduce latency and improve performance.\n4. Optimize your code: Review your code for inefficiencies and optimize it where possible. This can help reduce memory usage and improve overall performance.\n5. Use a JSON parser library: Utilize a JSON parsing library that provides efficient processing of large JSON responses. This can help reduce processing time and improve performance.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively handle large-scale JSON-formatted API replies and improve the performance of your application."

If not then I would consider starting with base SAS, you would be able to get by without it using the likes of Enterprise Miner, but I find by understanding base SAS you can pick up all the other elements easier, and it lets you get in behind the the scenes of the point and click interface when needed. \n\nSo it definitely wouldn't hurt to have a certificate when applying for jobs. However it will tend to be larger companies who will be using SAS because it's expensive. So if you're looking to get into say, a large financial institution it might help, not so much for the start-up/tech scene.\n\nThat said, if your goal is getting into a data science masters then I'm not sure SAS should be top of my list... Depending on what you already have, a few things I would look into are R, Python, SQL, D3.js, Hadoop, other types of databases (eg neo4j), I'm sure others could suggest more. \n\nIf you're just looking to improve your knowledge before going into the course, then consider taking a coursera course in the subject over the summer, some of them will give you a very good base, I've gone through Bill Howe's Intro to Data Science, Andrew Ng's Machine Learning - both are excellent and would be a very good way to spend your time. Even if they're not running at the moment, go through the videos and maybe go back to do the assignments when they are running.\n\nIf you're looking for something demonstrable to show an admissions office, then maybe consider taking coming up with a project of some sort to demonstrate knowledge of the things I mentioned, or enter a few kaggle contests (forcing yourself to use tools/languages you haven't used before)... \n\nI've found that places looking for analysts tend to be interested in 'generalists', as in people who would happily pick up any language on the job and figure out only as much of it as they need to get something done. \n\nSo in my opinion you would be better off getting a small bit of experience in a as many different languages/tools as possible than trying to specialise in SAS at this point. Then in interviews, no matter what the language or tool they throw at you, you can say you have some experience in it.",
            "Wow, thank you so much for the great, lengthy advice. I've gotten the base SAS certificate last summer, although I might not remember all of it..\n\nI was planning on getting the next two certificates but like you said it seems R and Python is a bit more popular at the moment. Truthfully speaking, my goal right now is admission to grad school. Since I have less than a year left til I apply, what would you recommend me to do right now that would help me chances if not the SAS certificates? I've checked out kaggles and it seems amazing. Should I try to do as many competition as possible on there?\n\nThanks again for the great advices you might've just changed my whole summer plans :P",
            "For what it's worth, I think its better to get enough of something that you can demonstrate you can learn more. So not remembering any of the SAS isn't an issue, for an entry level type job anything about a language seems to be enough, you can pick the rest up on the job (that's for analytics/data science/non-programmer jobs, for a programmer job you'll probably be expected to be proficient in the language already).\n\nBe completely honest about your level on a CV and in an interview. List all languages/tools you've ever done anything in but break them up by Proficient/Familiar With/Have Used or some similar grouping.\n\nI'd suggest it might be too early to specialize in SAS, wait until you're working in a SAS job, then see if another certificate would help.\n\nA few things I'd suggest if you just want to upskill (some of this isn't needed as you'll cover it in your course, but if you're just looking for a good use of your time):\n\n* Coursera: those two coursera.com course I mentioned (might be other good ones, do as many as you can) if they're not running just watch the videos, if they are do assignments and get a certificate. In the industry it seems to be recognised as 'this person mightn't be an expert, but they've got an interest and used their spare time to upskill'. There are also some R programming courses that are supposed to be good.\n\n* Kaggle: Pick an interesting competition, and set yourself a goal of downloading the data and getting any submission in using R. Then maybe try and tweak it to beat the benchmark score. Then either do the same competition, or a different one, using python. Could win yourself some money!\n\n* Blogs: Find some interesting blogs - datatau.com, hackernews, rbloggers are good, there are more too. Set up RSS feeds and keep up to speed, there are often people putting up posts of 'k-means algorithm visualised' or something that explains a method, try running any interesting code that's posted. Download any cool tools you see, often just installing something new is the biggest hurdle.\n\n* Hadoop: go to cloudera.com and try installing CDH, it needs linux as far as I know so maybe use a virtual machine (hortonworks has a windows version if required, but documentation/community for cloudera is better). Then play around with HIVE, Pig, HBase, Impala and the like, just for a 'hello world' type introduction, load up a fake dataset, run a few queries.\n\n* Python: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy all with the goal of using Scikit-Learn, will help with the kaggle competitions. Just came across Orange recently, seems to be quite good too, has an Enterprise Miner like interface for some modelling techniques.\n\nThere are also a lot of 'data science resources/how to become a data scientist' or similarly titled blogs on this subreddit, some of them have some good resources.\n\nThat's all I can think of now, others may be able to add to the list or suggest changes."

Do things at first which don't scale; that means rolling up your sleeves and talking to a ton of people (over the internet doesn't count) about what problems they're interested in solving.  Data science nearly always comes afterwards in the medium / long term.  If you don't understand your customer / market, you likely won't get to that point.

The hiring is almost always done based on interviews. What a certificate *might* have made a difference in is whether or not someone got an interview.",

If you're applying to a program and don't want to explicitly list courses on your resume, you can always say something like, \"taking X, Y, and Z courses on Coursera . . .\" on your cover letter.\n\nIf you gain the skills taught in the class then you can list them directly on your resume. You can include knowledge programming in R, Python, etc., and knowledge about getting and cleaning data, and doing statistical data analysis, and developing algorithms for machine learning. ",

So basically when they issued the certificate they knew it was me.\n\nThe free classes are good for learning things, but to the extent that you want to use them for either getting hired or getting into an educational program, I seriously doubt they mean anything.\n\nThe paid classes -- and certificates -- probably don't have much more value at this point, although I believe that will change over time.
